# SPH Fluid Simulation

Using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to Simulate Fluids in Unity.

* Calculate pressure, viscosity, and other forces using Navier-Stokes equations
* The kernel function governs contributions of the neighboring particles
* Grid-based neighborhood search improves the time complexity and simulation performance

This [demo](https://www.loom.com/share/e4ba361c56514cab9cb4f5284e5405cd) explains how the program works.
